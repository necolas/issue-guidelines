# Issue guidelines

This repository's [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) provides a generic set of
guidelines for developers to adapt and include in their own GitHub
repositories, thereby taking advantage of [GitHub's integration with
contributing guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines).

The section below can be included in your README to improve the visibility of
your contribution guidelines.

If you think this guide can be improved, please let me know.

## License & user agreement

The github [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license) on licensing clearly states: "without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work."

Although I believe the author has intended this work to be in the public domain or permisively licensed. No explicit license is stated and thus this work cannot legally by used by third parties.

Including a line on permited use or including a license file (for example an [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) would resolve this issue.
